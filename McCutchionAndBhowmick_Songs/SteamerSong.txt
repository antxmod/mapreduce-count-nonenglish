Text:
The steamer for Kakdwip
Carries men across.
It was filled up with passengers at the Petua Ghat
In the year 1341
On the 24th day of Jyestha --
It was a Thursday.

In Contai subdivision there had been music for a wedding:
From the village of Buia Balasi came the bride and bridegroom.

Taking on thirty seven cows,
The steamer set sail
And reached the middle of the river --
That day was a Thursday.

The owner said to the captain:
"Go slowly --
Why does the water keep coming in on one side?"
The owner and the captain began to quarrel,
And overworking the engine, damaged the steamer --

Those wicked fellows!

The bridegroom was wearing a wrist watch
And the bride a golden necklace,
The steamer tilted to one side --
The bride holds the bridegroom's hand:
If the two die together, what a supreme good fortune!

All the rich men's daughters
Are sitting on the upper deck,
And the young boys and girls
Were crying out, "O God!
Now we are going to die!
Alas, Lakshmi, goddess of fortune,
You gave us hopes and now you are setting us afloat
On the endless waters!"

In the salty ocean water,
Water a hundred feet deep,
The crowded steamer sank.
A few mangoes and coconuts were floating by,
And bundles of pan
Money purses sink down,
Many shawls float by.
The chimney bursts
And everything is shattered.

There was a boundlessly rich man
Full of goodness --
Mahendra Das Dani --
He supplied everybody with food and clothes.
The steamer for Kakdwip
Carries men across.
It was filled up with passengers at the Petua Ghat.
